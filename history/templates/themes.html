      <p>
        Acts of rebellion and resistance have been crucial catalysts for change throughout American history.
        From colonial opposition to British rule to modern civil rights movements, resistance challenges the status quo,
        sparks conflict, and drives social and political transformation.

      <h2 class="text-danger">Unity</h2>
      <p>
        Unity often emerges from shared struggle and common purpose. It has enabled disparate groups and colonies
        to come together in pursuit of liberty, justice, and nation-building. This theme highlights moments
        when Americans, despite differences, found strength in collective action.

      <h2 class="text-danger">Disunity</h2>
      <p>
        While resistance and rebellion can unite, they can also lead to division and conflict within society.
        Disunity reflects the complexities and contradictions in American history — including competing interests,
        social fractures, and unresolved tensions that sometimes threaten national cohesion.
